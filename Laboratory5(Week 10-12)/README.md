# Laboratory assignment 8-9

### About this assignment

For this assignment we had to add GUI to our app with the Qt framework

For the first iteration, we could not use the Qt Designer, but for the second iteration we were allowed to use it.
That's the reason for having two project directories 
 
We also had a bonus point if we create a graphic representation for our data.

 
##### Prerequisites
 * [Qt Framework](https://www.qt.io/)
 * [QCustomPlot](https://www.qcustomplot.com/)
 
### Requirements (the exact problem statement)


> **Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the problem you have been working on (Labs 5,6,7,8),
using Qt**
> * For the first iteration, due in Week 11, you should implement at least the design of the interface
and the list/table displaying the repository entities (administrator mode) should be populated.
> * For the first iteration, the GUI must be created and coded manually (no Qt Designer!).
> * For the second iteration, due in Week 12, all the required functionalities should be available using
the GUI. For this iteration, you may use Qt Designer, if you want to change the initial design of
your GUI.
> * The functionality of the application must be the same (including the one-by-one iteration of
objects for the user mode).

>  **ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT - BONUS POSSIBILITY (0.2 P)**
>
>  Create a graphic representation of the data in your application. You have an example below: a bar chart
representing the number of songs for each artist. Your representations can be a bar chart, a pie chart or
another type of chart. You can even use circles or rectangles or any other geometric shapes to “draw”
your data. To receive the bonus, the requirements must be implemented correctly, by week 12 and the
application must function properly
