# Laboratory assignment #1

### About this assignment


We had to implement/solve two problems from one set, and as lab activity we had to implement another one from other set.



### Requirements (the exact problem statement)


> Write a C application with a menu based console interface which solves the problems below. Each
requirement must be resolved using at least one function. All functions need to be specified.



##### The problems I had to solve:
 
 - Generate all the prime numbers smaller than a given natural number n

 - Given a vector of numbers, find the longest increasing contiguous subsequence, such the sum of that any 2 consecutive elements is a prime number.

 - Determine the first n pairs of twin numbers, where n is a given natural and non-null number. Two prime numbers p and q are called twin if q - p = 2.
